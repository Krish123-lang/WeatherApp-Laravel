# Weather App

The Ticket App is an web application that allows user create new tickets and also edit and delete their own ticket.

The Admin has the access to all the tickets. The admin also can create tickets. When admin performs some action i.e. resolve, reject ticket, an email notification is sent to the user that the ticket has been updated by admin.

All of the above operations can be performed only when user or Admin is logged in. If not then Register and Login.
